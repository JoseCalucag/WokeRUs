# Machine Learning for Lending Prediction

The project implements MAchine Learning in two progressive stages:

## Stage 1: Binary Classification
The first Machine Learning ALgorithm trains a binary classifier to predict if the applicant should be accepted or rejected for a loan from Lending Club. 
The following algorithms will be used and compared for accuracy and implementation efficiency:
1. Logistic Regression
2. SVM Algorithm
3. Neural Networks

## Stage 2: Interest Prediction
The second Machine Learning Algorithm trains a regression model to predict the interest rate that should be provided to an accepted loan borrower.
The following algorithms will be used and compared for accuracy and implementation efficiency:
1. Polynomial regression
2. Decision Tree Algorithm
3. Neural Networks

### Current Progress:
The team has successfully implemented the Logistic Regression for Stage 1 Analysis, yielding an 88.5% accuracy on test data. The next septs will to implement and compare SVM and Neural Algorithms before selecting the final model. ONe the final Stage 1 algorithm is selected, the team will commence Stage 2 Analysis.
