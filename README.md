<h1 align = "center"> Circle Role </h1>

The member in the circle role will create a mockup of a database with a set of sample data, or even fabricated data. This will ensure the database will work seamlessly with the rest of the project.

## Dataset ERD (Entity Relationship diagram)

- The dataset was available to us in a.csv file, and since only two tables were present an ERD was not necessary
- Since our dataset has two main categories one being accepted for loan and the other rejection, we did analyze the columns to find relational contents of both datasets.

## Database Setup and working Branch

- Our search for a more refined or clean data was not successful, and the lending club dataset being the most comprehensive.
- The dataset was uploaded into GitHub as a large file transfer, having a database in SQL or the cloud was not considered during our team discussions.
- Using the data uploaded on to GitHub, data was then wrangled for optimizing our dataset to suit our needs and the initial machine learning algorithm.
- 4 branches were initialized and setup on Github to ensure that the database and contents do not be overwritten (just because the sheer size)
